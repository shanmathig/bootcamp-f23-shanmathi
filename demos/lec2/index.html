        The Bits of Good bootcamp will bring you from zero to web dev hero, no
        matter your experience level coming in. We use this course to train new
        members of the Bits of Good organization so they can build the best web
        applications possible for our nonprofit partners. We've honed this
        curriculum for 2 years and counting, so we've made sure to work out any
        kinks along the way!
